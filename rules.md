# Intro
Halfcourt Jam is a basketball board game. 

## Objective
The first Team to score 11 points wins the game. 

## Components
- **Board**: The board where the Hoopers will play. 
- **Shot clock Marker**: this is used to show how many turns the team with the ball has to shoot. When this expires, the other team gets the ball. 
- **Score Markers**: these show what the score is.
- **10 Hooper Cards**: Each of these cards has a unique Hooper with different skills and abilities. In each game, you will play with just 3 of them. Each Hooper has a back side with an ability that is only available when they are Activated.
- **10 Hooper Markers**: Each of these corrosponds with the Hooper Cards. These are the pieces you will actually move around on the board.
- **1 Ball Die**: A 20-sided die which you will roll when you shoot or pass. The Ball tells you whether or not your shot or pass was successful.
- **Activation Markers**: Each Hoooper has a unique skill which is only used when they are Activated. These Markers show how close each Hooper is to being Activated.

## Setup
- Set up the board in the middle of the table
- Place the Score Markers in the 0 space on the scoreboard.
- Place the Shot Clock Marker on the 3 space of the Shot Clock Meter on the Board.

Each player determines a team, either Purple or Yellow. Then each Team will select 3 Hoopers each. 

For your first game, you should use these two sets of Hoopers, and skip the draft:
- **Yellow**: TBD
- **Purple**: TBD

If this is not your first game, you will start by Drafting Hoopers onto your team:
1. Sort all of the Hooper Cards by position. 
2. Lay out all Point Guards. 
3. Each Team may ban one of the Point Guards, meaning that neither Team can take them.
4. Yellow selects a Point Guard, then Purple selects one. Discard the rest.
5. Repeat this process for each position, alternating which Teams selects first.

Once you have selected your 3 Hoopers, place their card in front of you on the normal side (not their "activated" side), and place their marker on the board.

Always start the game with your 3 Hoopers on the baseline. The Yellow team gives the ball to one of their 3 Hoopers.

# Gameplay
Yellow always has the ball first. 

## Possession 
When a Hoooper gains possession of the ball, move the shot clock marker to 3. A possession will be made up of a maximum of 3 rounds. During a round, each of your Hoopers will take an action. 

A possession ends if the defense steals the ball, the defense rebounds the ball, the Shot Clock expires, or the offense scores. When any of these occur, the defense gains possession of the ball, and the shot clock returns to 3. If the offense gets their own rebound, the shot clock returns to 2.

## Round
Rounds simply consist of players taking turns performing an action with one of their Hoopers. The defense takes the first turn of a normal possession (the offense takes the first turn after a steal or a failed pass).

### Actions

On your turn, you may take action with each of your Hoopers. The number of actions they may take, and the effect of each action is determined by the stats on your Hooper's card. You may perform actions beginning with any of your 3 Hoopers, but you must only perform actions with 1 Hooper at a time.

On your turn you may do the following:

#### Move
You may always move. Moving 1 space costs 1 action.

- It costs 2 moves to move into a space occupied by an opponent Hooper. 
- You can never move through an opponent's screen, but you may freely pass through a teammate's screen.
- Screens: When you are done moving, even if you have no moves remaining, you may place your Hooper on the border between two spaces (you cannot do this if the Hooper you're moving has the ball). This indicates that you are setting a screen between the two spaces. While your Hooper is there, they cannot receive passes, their Defense numbers are considered zero, and they do not count toward reboundings numbers. If you were previously screening, and you move on this turn, first move your Hooper into either space you were straddling, then begin moving.

#### Pass
If your Hooper has the ball, they may pass it to any teammate for the cost of 1 action. However, you must roll the Ball to determine if it was successful. 

Defensive numbers work the same for passing and shooting. Add the defensive stats of the opposing Hoopers in the passer's space and the receiver's space. You must roll a number higher than those combined numbers.

Example: Ray is passing to Vic. Big Lee is on Vic's space, and has defense of 3. Then Hakeem is in Ray's space, and his defense is 4. Our defense difficulty number is 7, and we must roll an 8 or higher for the pass to be successful. 

Roll to Ball. If your roll is higher than the defense difficulty numer, the pass is complete. If not, the defending team takes the ball. The defense may give the ball to any of their Hoopers in the passer's space, or the intended recipient's space. After a failed pass, the team who took possession of the ball goes first on the next turn.

- The lowest difficulty a pass can have is 1. So even if there is no defense present, you still must roll the ball. If you roll a 1 on an undefended pass, the defense gets the ball on their baseline as if you had just scored.
- You may never pass to a teammate who is behind the half court line.
- Note: immediately after a stolen pass, the shot clock will reset, and then defense will take the next turn. there are Hoopers on your team who have not taken an action on this turn, your turn will still end immediately.

#### Shoot
**Importantly**: if you shoot the ball, this is the only action your Hooper takes on their turn. You cannot move and then shoot in a single turn. If your Hoooper has the ball, they may shoot. Roll the Ball to determine if the shot went in. Here is how to calculate the shot difficulty: 

- Start with the Shooting Difficulty number in your Hooper's space, which is printed on the board.
- Add the defense stat of any opponents in your space.
- Subtract your Hooper's Shooter Bonus stat. 

This total is your Shot Difficulty. Roll the Ball. If your roll is higher than your Shot Difficulty, the shot is good. If not, the shot is a miss.

*Example: your Hooper is shooting from a space that has a difficulty of 8. There is an opponent on the space whose Defense stat is 3, so we add 3. But our Hooper has a Shooter Bonus of -2. This means that our shot difficulty is 9. We must roll a 10 or higher to make the shot.*

The lowest difficulty a shot can have is 1, and the highest is 19. In other words, there is *always a chance* to make the shot or miss the shot, regardless of how hard or easy it is.

You may take a shot from behind the half court line, but the difficulty is always 19, regardless of the Hooper's shooting bonus.

If your shot is good, update the scoreboard, the defense picks a Hooper, gives them the ball, and places them on any space on the base line. Reset the shot clock to 3.

**Rebounding**: If you miss the shot, the rebound goes to the team who has more Hoopers in the space directly below the rim. If there are no Hoopers in that space, the team with the most Hoopers in the next arc of spaces rebounds the ball. Continue outward until there is a region containing at least one Hooper. If that region has an equal number of Hoopers from each team, the tie always goes to the Defense. If your team rebounds the ball and you have multiple Hoopers in that region, you decide who gets the ball. If the defending team got the rebound, they immediately begin a possession and set the Shot Clock to 3. If the offense got the rebound, the Shot Clock is set to 2.

- Note: immediately after a missed or made shot, the shot clock will reset, and then defense will take the next turn. So if you intend to move or rest another Hooper on this turn, do it before shooting.

#### Steal
If you are on defense and you are on same space as the ball-handler, you may attempt to steal the ball. This costs 1 action, and so you can only do it if you have an action to spend. The ball handler rolls the die. If they roll higher than your Hooper's defensive number, they keep the ball. Otherwise, you successfully steal the ball. Each Hooper may only attempt 1 steal per turn. 

If a steal is successful, the team who stole goes first on the next possession.

### Hustle Plays and Exhaustion
On your turn, you may choose for any of your Hoopers to hustle. On this turn, that Hooper gets +3 actions. Then, move them into the exhausted position on their energy mat.  

**Exhaustion**: when your Hooper is in the exhausted state, they get -1 Action on their turns, and cannot hustle. In order to leave the exhausted state, they must use an entire turn to rest, meaning that they will perform no actions.

### Activating
Each Hooper also has a special perk for being Activated. Each Hooper gets Activated differently. For example, a Hooper might require 3 complete passes before Activating. Every time you complete a pass with them, put an Activation Marker on their card to show progress.

When one of your Hoopers Activates, flip their Card to the Activated side so it is clear that they now have their special ability, and discard the markers on them.

Some special abilities require that you immediately exhaust, even if you did not perform a Hustle play. When performing these actions, immediately move your Hooper to the exhausted state on the energy mat.

- In some cases the ability might be immediately useful this turn. That is valid. Abilities activate immediately and apply to the current turn.

### Shot clock
After each round, which consists of the defense and then offense taking a turn, move the shot clock down a level. If the shot clock reaches zero without the offense taking a shot, the ball is turned over. The defense chooses a player to take possession of the ball, places them on any baseline space, and a new round begins.

## End of Game
The game ends when a team has more than 11 points, and it is not tied. Since Yellow always goes first, Purple must always take the last turn. If it is tied, continue playing until Purple takes a turn and the score is not tied.
