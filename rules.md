# Intro
Halfcourt Jam is a basketball board game. 

## Objective
The first player to score 15 points wins the game. 

## Components
- **Board**: The board where the Hoopers will play. 
- **Shot clock Marker**: this is used to show how many turns the team with the ball has to shoot. When this expires, the other team gets the ball. 
- **Score Markers**: these show what the score is.
- **10 Hooper Cards**: Each of these cards has a unique Hooper with different skills and abilities. In each game, you will play with just 5 of them. Each Hooper has a back side with an ability that is only available when they are Activated.
- **10 Hooper Chits**: Each of these corrosponds with the Hooper Cards. These are the pieces you will actually move around on the board.
- **1 Ball Die**: A 20-sided die which you will roll when you shoot or pass. The Ball tells you whether or not your shot or pass was successful.
- **Hustle Mat**: Each Hooper starts in the Normal Zone. 
- **Activation Markers**: Each Hoooper has a unique skill which is only used when they are Activated. These Markers show how close each Hooper is to being Activated.

## Setup
- Set up the board in the middle of the table
- Place the Score Markers in the 0 spaces.
- Place the Shot Clock Marker on the 4 space of the Shot Clock Meter on the Board.

Each player determines a team, either Purple or Yellow. Then each player will select 5 players each. 

For your first game, you should use these two sets of players, and skip the draft:
- **Yellow**: Harden, Wilt, Shane, Kyrie, and Ron
- **Purple**: Lebron, Ray, Isiah, Hakeem, and Draymond

If this is not your first game, you will start by Drafting players onto your team:
1. Sort all of the Hooper Cards by position. 
2. Lay out all Point Guards. 
3. Yellow selects a Point Guard, then Purple selects one. Discard the rest.
4. Repeat this process for each position, alternating which player selects first.

Always start the game with the players in the spaces in the diagram below.

# Gameplay
Yellow always has the ball first. 

## Possession 
At the start of each possession, the offense chooses a player and moves them to any space on the outside border, past the 3 point line, with the ball. During a possession, the offense and defense will alternate taking turns, beginning with the defense.

A possession ends after the ball is stolen, the defense rebounds the ball, the Shot Clock expires, or the offense scores. 

## Turn
On your turn, you make take actions. If you are on offense, you may take up to 4 actions. If you are on defense, you can take up to 3 actions. Each Hooper on your team can only take 1 Action per turn.

Here are the actions available:

### Actions

#### Move
The number of spaces a Hooper with this action is determined by their Speed. 

- You may move through another Hooper's space, but only if you have enough movements to get past them. In other words, if you only have one move left, you cannot move into the Hooper's space. But if you have 2 moves left, you may move to the space on the other side of them.
- Screens: With your final move, you may move halfway into another space. This indicates that you are setting a screen between the two spaces. While your Hooper is there, no other Hooper can move between these spaces along the border where you are setting your screen. Other Hoopers may still occupy each of the spaces your Hooper is screening between.
- 3 in the Key: If you start your turn with a player in the key, and you do not move them out before your turn ends, the other team gets a Free Throw. 

#### Pass
If your Hooper has the ball, they may pass it to any teammate. However, you must roll the Ball to determine if it was successful. Find all opponent Hoopers who are on or adjacent to the passer's space, or the receiver's space. Tally up the total Defense stats of the opponents in all Defensive spaces. That is your difficulty score. Roll to Ball. If your roll is higher than that number, the pass is complete. If not, the defending team takes the ball, and begins their possession. 

#### Shoot
If your Hooper has the ball, they may shoot. However, you must roll the Ball to know if the shot went in. Start with your Hooper's shooting stat. Use the lowest number if they are shooting from the key, the middle number if they are in the midrange, or the highest number if they are beyond the 3-point line. Then, find every opponent on or adjacent to your space(including diagonally). Add the defensive stats of each of these opponents to your shooting stat. This total is your Shot Difficulty. Roll the Ball. If your roll is higher than your Shot Difficulty, the shot is good. If not, the shot is a miss.

- Rebounding: If you miss the shot, the rebound goes to the team who has more hoppers 1 space away from the rim. Tally up the defensive stats of the Hoopers 1 space from  the rim. Whichever team has more total defense under the rim gets the ball. If the defending team got the rebound, they immediately begin a possession. If the offense got the rebound, the Shot Clock is reset, and the defense takes their next turn as usual.

### Hustle Plays
Each Hooper can be in one of 3 Energy states: 

1. Energized: this Hooper can make a Hustle Play on your turn.
2. Normal
3. Exhausted: this Hooper cannot do anything during your turn.

During your turn, you can take two actions with a single Hooper if they are Energized. This is called a Hustle Play. After doing this, move the Hooper to the Exhausted state. This means that on their next turn, they cannot take any actions. 

On your turn, if you do not take an Action with a Hooper, move them up the Energy Status if you can.

### Activating
Each Hooper also has a special perk for being Activated. Each Hooper gets Activated differently. Some need to do specific things multiple times (for example: hit two 3-pointers), while others just need specific circumstances to happen (for example: when your opponent has 10 or more points).

When one of your Hoopers Activates, flip their Card and their Chit to the Activated side so it is clear that they now have their special ability.

## End of Game
The game ends when a team has more than 15 points, and it is not tied. Since Yellow always goes first, Purple must always take the last turn.
