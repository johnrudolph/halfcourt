# Intro
Halfcourt Jam is a basketball board game. 

## Objective
The first Team to score 11 points wins the game. 

## Components
- **Board**: The board where the Hoopers will play. 
- **Shot clock Marker**: this is used to show how many turns the team with the ball has to shoot. When this expires, the other team gets the ball. 
- **Score Markers**: these show what the score is.
- **10 Hooper Cards**: Each of these cards has a unique Hooper with different skills and abilities. In each game, you will play with just 3 of them. Each Hooper has a back side with an ability that is only available when they are Activated.
- **10 Hooper Markers**: Each of these corrosponds with the Hooper Cards. These are the pieces you will actually move around on the board.
- **1 Ball Die**: A 20-sided die which you will roll when you shoot or pass. The Ball tells you whether or not your shot or pass was successful.
- **Activation Markers**: Each Hoooper has a unique skill which is only used when they are Activated. These Markers show how close each Hooper is to being Activated.
- **Action cards** Each Team has an identical set of action cards, which they use to set plays for their Hoopers. 

## Setup
- Set up the board in the middle of the table
- Place the Score Markers in the 0 space on the scoreboard.
- Place the Shot Clock Marker on the 4 space of the Shot Clock Meter on the Board.

Each player determines a team, either Purple or Yellow. Then each Team will select 3 Hoopers each. 

For your first game, you should use these two sets of Hoopers, and skip the draft:
- **Yellow**: TBD
- **Purple**: TBD

If this is not your first game, you will start by Drafting Hoopers onto your team:
1. Sort all of the Hooper Cards by position. 
2. Lay out all Point Guards. 
3. Each Team may ban one of the Point Guards, meaning that neither Team can take them.
4. Yellow selects a Point Guard, then Purple selects one. Discard the rest.
5. Repeat this process for each position, alternating which Teams selects first.

Once you have selected your 3 Hoopers, place their card in front of you on the normal side (not their "activated" side), and place their marker on the board.

Always start the game with the Hoopers in the spaces in the diagram below.

# Gameplay
Yellow always has the ball first. 

## Possession 
When a Hoooper gains possession of the ball, move the shot clock marker to 3. A possession will be made up of a maximum of 3 rounds. During a round, each of your Hoopers will take an action. 

A possession ends if the defense steals the ball, the defense rebounds the ball, the Shot Clock expires, or the offense scores. When any of these occur, the defense gains possession of the ball, and the shot clock returns to 3. 

## Round
At the beginning of each round, both teams set their plays. In front of each of your Hooper cards, place one face-down action card. This is the action you intend for them to perform. The order of Hoopers does not matter: during your turn you can resolve them in any order you want. 

Once both Teams have set their 3 action cards face-down, take turns revealing and resolving them one at a time, beginning with the offense.

### Actions

The action deck has a relatively small number of options. The effect of each action is determined by the stats on your Hooper's card.

#### Move
The number of spaces a Hooper with this action is determined by their Speed. 

- Your Hooper may move into the space of an opposing Hooper. But you cannot have 2 of our own Hoopers on a space.
- Screens: With your final move, you may move halfway into another space. This indicates that you are setting a screen between the two spaces. While your Hooper is there, Hoopers from the other team can move between these spaces along the border where you are setting your screen. Other Hoopers may still occupy each of the spaces your Hooper is screening between.

#### Pass
If your Hooper has the ball, they may pass it to any teammate. However, you must roll the Ball to determine if it was successful. Find all opponent Hoopers who are on the passer's space, or the receiver's space. Tally up the total defense stats of the opponents in all Defensive spaces. That is your difficulty score. Roll to Ball. If your roll is higher than that number, the pass is complete. If not, the defending team takes the ball, and begins their possession. The defense may give the ball to any of their Hoopers in the passer's space, or the intended recipient's space.

#### Shoot
Roll the Ball to determine if the shot went in. Here is how to calculate the shot difficulty: 

- Start with the Shooting Difficulty number in your Hooper's space, which is printed on the board.
- If there is an opponent on your space, add their Defense stat. 
- Subtract your Hooper's Shooter Bonus stat. 

This total is your Shot Difficulty. Roll the Ball. If your roll is higher than your Shot Difficulty, the shot is good. If not, the shot is a miss.

*Example: your Hooper is shooting from a space that has a difficulty of 8. There is an opponent on the space whose Defense stat is 7. But our Hooper has a Shooter Bonus of 6. This means that our Difficulty is 9. We must roll a 10 or higher to make the shot.*

The lowest difficulty a shot can have is 1, and the highest is 19. In other words, there is *always a chance* to make the shot or miss the shot, regardless of how hard or easy it is.

**Rebounding**: If you miss the shot, the rebound goes to the team who has more Hoopers in the space directly below the rim. If there are no Hoopers in that space, the team with the most Hoopers in the next arc of spaces rebounds the ball. Continue outward until there is a region containing at least one Hooper. If that region has an equal number of Hoopers from each team, the tie always goes to the Defense. If your team rebounds the ball and you have multiple Hoopers in that region, you decide who gets the ball. If the defending team got the rebound, they immediately begin a possession and set the Shot Clock to 3. If the offense got the rebound, the Shot Clock is set to 2.

### Audibles

When revealing an action card for one of your Hoopers, you may always do a different action than what is printed on the card, but with a penalty. You may: 

- **Move** half the numbers of spaces (rounded down) that you could normally move.
- **Shoot**, but with 5 additional difficulty added to the shot.
- **Pass**, but with 5 additional difficulty added to the pass.

If you ever reveal an Action that you cannot play (for example, the card you reveal says pass or shoot, and that Hooper does not have the ball), you must do a different action with a penalty.

### Hustle Plays
On your turn, you may play a card from your hand for a Hooper who already revealed their Action card. This is called a Hustle Play. After you perform this second action for them, you Exhaust them: turn the card to face horizontally. When Exhausted, a Hooper will not take *any* actions on the following round. At the end of the next round, turn them to face vertically as usual again. You may only make a Hustle Play with a given Hooper once per round.

*Note*: When all 3 Hoopers have Action cards in front of them, you still have an opportunity to do a Hustle Play. You may also pass, meaning that you will forego the opportunity to do a Hustle Play. The round ends once the Offense and Defense both pass. 

### Activating
Each Hooper also has a special perk for being Activated. Each Hooper gets Activated differently. Some need to do specific things multiple times (for example: hit two 3-pointers), while others just need specific circumstances to happen (for example: when your opponent has 6 or more points).

When one of your Hoopers Activates, flip their Card to the Activated side so it is clear that they now have their special ability.

## End of Game
The game ends when a team has more than 11 points, and it is not tied. Since Yellow always goes first, Purple must always take the last turn.
